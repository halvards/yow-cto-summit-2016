					<h1>APRA</h1>
					<h2 style="text-transform: none;">Australian Prudential Regulation Authority</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						The regulator of the Australian financial services industry, established July 1998.<br>
						Oversees banks, credit unions, building societies, insurance, superannuation.<br>

						By some, credited with helping Australia avoid the worst of the GFC.<br>

					<h2>Myth</h2>
					<p>Offshoring</p>
					<blockquote style="width: 71%;">&ldquo;Using a cloud provider that is incorporated in another country is considered offshoring by APRA regardless of where the data centre is located.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
						This would cover most public cloud providers.<br>
            APRA has strict reporting standards for offshoring.<br><br>
            The US Patriot Act often gets a mention, can they access the data?<br>
            It's true that legal jurisdiction can get complicated, and this should be considered.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

        <section>
					<h2>Sources of myth</h2>
          <ol>
  					<li>Prudential Practice Guide CPG 235 - Managing Data Risk:<br>
            Six of eight mentions of &quot;outsource&quot; is written as <q>&ldquo;outsource/offshore&rdquo;</q></li><br>
            <li>2010 APRA letter to regulated entities contained the subject line <q>&ldquo;Outsourcing and offshoring - Specific considerations when using cloud computing services'</q></li>
          </ol>
          <aside class="notes">
						Confuses outsourcing with offshoring.<br><br>
            Gives the impression that public cloud is automatically offshoring.<br><br>
            Early on, most public cloud didn't have data centres in Australia.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

					<img src="images/coat-of-arms-apra-logo.png" alt="Australian Government Coat of Arms and APRA logo" style="margin: 0;border: 0; box-shadow: 0 0 0; width: 60%;">
					<img src="images/apra-cloud-information-paper.png" ="Information Paper: Outsourcing involving shared computing services (including cloud)" style="border: 0; box-shadow: 0 0 0; width: 90%;">
					<aside class="notes">
						Public cloud considered outsourcing.<br>
						Entities must consult with APRA prior to entering into outsourcing arrangements where offshoring is involved.<br>
						APRA &quot;questions the appropriateness of transitioning systems of record to a public cloud environment.&quot;<br>

				</section>

        <section>
					<h2>Evidence against myth</h2>
					<p>APRA Prudential Standard CPS 231 - Outsourcing:</p>
					<blockquote style="width: 72%;">&ldquo;Offshoring includes arrangements where the service provider is incorporated in Australia, but the physical location of the outsourced activity is outside Australia.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<blockquote style="width: 72%;">&ldquo;Offshoring does not include arrangements where the physical location of an outsourced activity is within Australia but the service provider is not incorporated in Australia.&rdquo;</blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">
						So it's all about the physical location of the data centre.<br><br>
            Offshoring is confused with outsourcing.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

        <section>
					<h2>Myth</h2>
					<p>Business continuity</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;APRA's prudential standards says we must be ready to redeploy applications in-house at any time in case of a significant disruption at the cloud provider.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
						Implication: We must have full redundancy on internal hardware, which will be too expensive.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Source of myth</h2>
					<p>APRA Prudential Standard CPS 231: Outsourcing</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;An APRA-regulated institution must be able to demonstrate to APRA that [...] it has taken into account [...] contingency issues in accordance with <a href="http://apra.gov.au/CrossIndustry/Documents/Prudential-Standard-CPS-232-Business-Continuity-Management-(July-2017).pdf">Prudential Standard CPS 232 Business Continuity Management</a> should the outsourced activity need to be brought in-house&rdquo;</blockquote>

					<img src="images/cps232.png" alt="APRA Prudential Standard CPS 232: Business Continuity Management" style="border: 0; box-shadow: 0 0 0; width: 80%;">
					<aside class="notes">
						&quot;An APRA-regulated institution must maintain at all times a documented BCP [business continuity plan]&rdquo;<br>
						&quot;Where material business activities are outsourced, an APRA-regulated institution must satisfy itself as to the adequacy of the outsourced service provider’s BCP&quot;<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Evidence against myth [1]</h2>
					<p>APRA Information Paper: Outsourcing involving shared computing services (including cloud)</p>
					<blockquote style="width: 80%;">&ldquo;[...] under CPS 231 and SPS 231, APRA-regulated entities must develop contingency plans that allow for the shared computing service to be <b>transitioned to an alternative service provider (or brought in-house), if required</b>.&rdquo;</blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">
						Using an alternative service provider is an option.<br><br>
						'If required' - is the application critical to business continuity?<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Evidence against myth [2]</h2>
					<p>No mention of &quot;in-house&quot; in CPS 232</p>
					<blockquote style="width: 76%;">&ldquo;An APRA-regulated institution must maintain at all times a documented BCP [business continuity plan]&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<blockquote style="width: 76%;">&ldquo;Where material business activities are outsourced, an APRA-regulated institution must satisfy itself as to the adequacy of the outsourced service provider's BCP&rdquo;</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Demonstrate Understanding</h2>
					<p>From 2010 letter on 'Outsourcing and offshoring - Specific considerations when using cloud computing services':</p>
					<blockquote style="width: 81%;">&ldquo;In APRA's view, both materiality and risk assessments necessitate a detailed understanding of the [...] business processes [..], the technology architecture and the sensitive information [...] impacted by the outsourcing arrangement. APRA has observed that, <b>to date, assessments of cloud computing proposals typically lack sufficient consideration of these factors</b>.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
            2015 Information paper: &quot;Observed weaknesses&quot;:<br><br>
						Proposals driven purely by cost considerations rather than strategy and architectural roadmap.<br><br>
						Business cases that focus only on benefits and don't provide visibility of risks.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

        <section>
					<h1>APP</h1>
					<h2 style="text-transform: none;">Australian Privacy Principles</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Outline how Australian Government agencies, private sector and not-for-profit organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3M, all private health service providers and some small businesses ('APP entities') must manage personal information.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Myth</h2>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;The Australian Privacy Principles mean that personal information cannot touch servers outside Australia without first obtaining the person's consent.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
						Privacy is complicated!<br>
						Amends Privacy Act 1988. Replaced the National PP and Information PP in March 2014.<br>
						Applies to medium and large enterprises as well as government agencies.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Source of myth</h2>
					<p>APP 8: Cross-border disclosure of personal information</p>
					<blockquote style="width: 80%;">&ldquo;8.1: Before an APP entity discloses personal information [...] the entity must take such steps [...] to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<blockquote style="width: 80%;" class="fragment">&ldquo;8.2: Subclause 8.1 does not apply [...] if [...] the entity expressly informs the individual [...] [and] the individual consents to the disclosure&rdquo;</blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">
						So disclosure to an overseas recipient requires informing the individual and getting consent.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>&quot;Use&quot; or &quot;disclose&quot;?</h2>
					<p>APP 6 guidelines: Use or disclosure of personal information</p>
          <blockquote style="width: 86%;">&ldquo;An APP entity 'uses' information where it handles [...] the information, <b>within the entity's effective control</b>.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<blockquote style="width: 86%;" class="fragment">&ldquo;An APP entity 'discloses' personal information where it makes it accessible to others outside the entity and <b>releases the subsequent handling of the information from its effective control</b>.&rdquo;</blockquote>
          <blockquote style="width: 86%;" class="fragment">&ldquo;[...] the distinction is relevant to [...] the disclosure of personal information to an overseas recipient.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
						And &quot;the distinction is relevant to [...] the disclosure of personal information to an overseas recipient&quot;<br>
						'Unauthorised access' is also different.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>ASD</h1>
					<h2 style="text-transform: none;">Australian Signals Directorate</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Certifies cloud providers for government use.<br>
						Provides security accreditation for government systems.<br>
						Publishes the Australian Government Information Security Manual, which governs the security of government IT systems.<br>
						Publishes Cloud Computing Security advice.<br>
						Part of Department of Defence.<br>
						This isn't all they do, it's just what's most relevant to this talk.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Myth</h2>
					<p>Multi-tenancy and virtualisation</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) does not allow government agencies and departments to use shared multi-tenant hosting due to the risk of breach from a compromised tenant.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
						ASD is part of the Department of Defence. You'll know about this if you work in government.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Source of myth</h2>
					<p>ASD Cloud Computing Security Considerations (Sept 2012)</p>
					<blockquote style="width: 85%;">&ldquo;What assurance do I have that the virtualisation [...] mechanisms guarantee adequate logical and network segregation between multiple tenants [...]?&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<blockquote style="width: 85%;">&ldquo;For Infrastructure as a Service, the virtualisation software [...] was typically not originally designed to provide segregation for security purposes.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
						ASD considers this document superceeded by their newer advice. It's still on their website because &quot;some readers might find its conversational format useful to start a discussion&quot;
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
          <h2>Virtualisation</h2>
          <p>From ASD's Cloud Computing Security for Tenants:</p>
					<p>Risk: <q>&ldquo;Tenant's data compromised by another malicious/compromised tenant&rdquo;</q></p>
					<p>Mitigation: <q>&ldquo;Use multi-tenancy mechanisms provided by the CSP [cloud service provider] e.g. to separate the tenant's web application and network traffic from other tenants&rdquo;</q></p>
          <aside class="notes">
						With 10 footnotes just on this risk!<br>
						Half of the foonotes arelinks showing fixed security vulnerabilities in VMware, Hyper-V, XEN, KVM<br>
						The other half: links to reported security vulnerabilities in Docker.<br>
            Very useful list of risks and mitigations of using cloud IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.<br>
					</aside>
        </section>

				<section>
          <h2>Interesting quote</h2>
          <p>From ASD's Cloud Computing Security for Tenants:</p>
					<blockquote style="width: 80%;">&ldquo;Organisations need to perform a risk assessment and implement associated mitigations before using cloud services. [...] Organisations need to compare these risks against an objective risk assessment of using <b>inhouse computer systems which might: be poorly secured; have inadequate availability; or, be unable to meet modern business requirements</b>.&rdquo;</blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">
            Are your existing practices up to scratch?<br><br>
            If you're just getting started with considering public cloud risks and mitigations, the guidance from ASD is an excellent starting point.<br>
					</aside>
        </section>

				<section>
					<h2>Read the policies yourself!</h2>
					<p>Most of what you hear is interpretations of policies.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
						Interpretations are often biased, and based on information that may be out of date.<br>
            Maybe you can come up with another interpretation?<br><br>
            In the end, most regulation is good advice.
            As a private person I'm glad organisations are forced to take security and privacy seriously.<br>
