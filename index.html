					<h2>Myth 1</h2>
					<p>Business continuity</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;APRA's prudential standards says we must be ready to redeploy applications in-house at any time in case of a significant disruption at the cloud provider.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
						Implication: We must have full redundancy on internal hardware, which will be too expensive.

					<h1>APRA</h1>
					<h2>Australian Prudential Regulation Authority</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						The regulator of the Australian financial services industry, established on 1 July 1998.<br>
						Oversees banks, credit unions, building societies, insurance companies, and most of the superannuation industry.<br>
						By many, credited with helping Australia avoid the GFC.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Source of myth 1</h2>
					<p>APRA Prudential Standard CPS 231: Outsourcing</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;An APRA-regulated institution must be able to demonstrate to APRA that [...] it has taken into account [...] contingency issues in accordance with <a href="http://apra.gov.au/CrossIndustry/Documents/Prudential-Standard-CPS-232-Business-Continuity-Management-(July-2017).pdf">Prudential Standard CPS 232 Business Continuity Management</a> should the outsourced activity need to be brought in-house&rdquo;</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Evidence against myth 1 [1]</h2>
					<p>APRA Information Paper: Outsourcing involving shared computing services (including cloud)</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;Additionally, under CPS 231 and SPS 231, APRA-regulated entities must develop contingency plans that allow for the shared computing service to be transitioned to an alternative service provider (or brought in-house), if required.&rdquo;</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Evidence against myth 1 [2]</h2>
					<p>No mention of &quot;in-house&quot; in CPS 232</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;An APRA-regulated institution must maintain at all times a documented BCP [business continuity plan]&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;Where material business activities are outsourced, an APRA-regulated institution
must satisfy itself as to the adequacy of the outsourced service provider’s BCP&rdquo;</blockquote>

					</aside>

				<section>
					<h2>The Key</h2>
					<p>From 2010 letter on outsourcing and offshoring - Specific considerations when using cloud computing services:</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;In APRA's view, both materiality and risk assessments necessitate a detailed understanding of the [...] business processes [..], the technology architecture and the sensitive information [...] impacted by the outsourcing arrangement. APRA has observed that, <b>to date, assessments of cloud computing proposals typically lack sufficient consideration of these factors</b>.&rdquo;</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Myth 2</h2>
					<p>Privacy</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;The Australian Privacy Principles mean that personal information cannot touch servers outside Australia without first obtaining the person's consent.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
						Privacy is complicated!<br>
						Amends Privacy Act 1988. Replaced the National PP and Information PP in March 2014.<br>
						Applies to medium and large enterprises as well as government agencies.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>APP</h1>
					<h2>Australian Privacy Principles<br></h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Outline how Australian Government agencies, private sector and not-for-profit organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3M, all private health service providers and some small businesses ('APP entities') must manage personal information.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Source of myth 2</h2>
					<p>Australian Privacy Principle 8:<br>Cross-border disclosure of personal information</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;8.1: Before an APP entity discloses personal information [...] the entity must take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles&rdquo;</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Source of myth 2 [2]</h2>
					<p>continuing...</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;8.2: Subclause 8.1 does not apply [...] if [...] the entity expressly informs the individual that if he or she consents to the disclosure of the information, subclause 8.1 will not apply to the disclosure; [and] the individual consents to the disclosure&rdquo;</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>&quot;Use&quot; or &quot;disclose&quot;?</h2>
					<p>APP 6 guidelines: Use or disclosure of personal information</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;An APP entity 'discloses' personal information where it makes it accessible to others outside the entity and releases the subsequent handling of the information from its effective control.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;An APP entity 'uses' information where it handles [...] the information, within the entity's effective control.&rdquo;</blockquote>
          <!--<blockquote>&ldquo;[...] the distinction is relevant to [...] the disclosure of personal information to an overseas recipient.&rdquo;</blockquote>-->
					<aside class="notes">
						On use: <i>within the entity's effective control</i><br>
						And &quot;the distinction is relevant to [...] the disclosure of personal information to an overseas recipient&quot;<br>
                        'Unauthorised access' is also different.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Myth 3</h2>
					<p>Multi-tenancy and virtualisation</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) does not allow government agencies and departments to use shared multi-tenant hosting due to the risk of breach from a compromised tenant.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
						ASD is part of the Department of Defence. You'll know about this if you work in government.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Source of myth 3</h2>
					<p>ASD Cloud Computing Security Considerations (Sept 2012)</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;What assurance do I have that the virtualisation [...] mechanisms guarantee adequate logical and network segregation between multiple tenants [...]?&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;For Infrastructure as a Service, the virtualisation software [...] was typically not originally designed to provide segregation for security purposes.&rdquo;</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
						ASD considers this document superceeded by their newer advice. It's still on their website because &quot;some readers might find its conversational format useful to start a discussion&quot;
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
          <h2>Virtualisation</h2>
          <p>From ASD's Cloud Computing Security for Tenants:</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;Use multi-tenancy mechanisms provided by the CSP [cloud service provider] e.g. to separate the tenant's web application and network traffic from other tenants&rdquo;</blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">
						Followed by links showing fixed security vulnerabilities in VMware, Hyper-V, XEN, KVM, and known vulnerabilities in Docker.
					</aside>
        </section>

				<section>
          <h2>Interesting Quote</h2>
          <p>From ASD's Cloud Computing Security for Tenants:</p>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;Organisations need to perform a risk assessment and implement associated mitigations before using cloud services. [...] Organisations need to compare these risks against an objective risk assessment of using <b>inhouse computer systems which might: be poorly secured; have inadequate availability; or, be unable to meet modern business requirements</b>.&rdquo;</blockquote>
